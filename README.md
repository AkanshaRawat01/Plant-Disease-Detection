# Plant-Disease-Detection
This project focuses on the development of an early plant disease detection system using IoT, Raspberry Pi 4, and a camera module. We trained, tested and compared the performance of various deep learning models including ResNet50, InceptionV, ResNet152V2 and InceptionResnetV2 to find the best model for the training of disease detection in crop.
